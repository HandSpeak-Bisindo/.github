# Machine Learning
Using over 3000 images for our dataset from kaggle and combined with self-made dataset.
Using CNN to train the data set and generate .Json model using python.
Deploy our model using Tensorflow.js 

These are some resources that you can use to replicate our work

A. Dataset : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1znB9RNheIBSHRWsa-i2DjAsXKJMMGmLu?usp=drive_link

B. Our CNN training code: [Train_Code_2.ipynb](https://github.com/HandSpeak-Bisindo/ML/blob/main/Train_Code_2.ipynb)
We used many techniques (Callbacks, Regularization, Dropout) to prevent overfitting and reached 87% accuracy, [our latest model](https://github.com/HandSpeak-Bisindo/ML/tree/main/model).

C. Python Deploy Code: [Deploy.py](https://github.com/HandSpeak-Bisindo/ML/blob/main/Deploy.py)


There are some false detection, and need further improvement for our projects.
